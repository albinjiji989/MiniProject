# Frontend Environment Setup

Please create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory with the following content:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

This file is needed for the frontend to connect to the backend API.

## What I Fixed

✅ **Fixed AuthContext export** - Added missing `AuthContext` export
✅ **Fixed api export** - Added missing `api` named export  
✅ **Updated all useAuth imports** - Changed from `hooks/useAuth` to `contexts/AuthContext`
✅ **Removed duplicate files** - Deleted duplicate `useAuth.js` and `ProtectedRoute` component
✅ **Fixed import paths** - All imports now point to correct locations

## Next Steps

1. Create the `.env` file as shown above
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. The frontend should now start without import errors
