## 🎯 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Mistake | ✅ Correct Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "All Golden Retrievers are 10/10 child-friendly" | Test THIS dog with actual children |
| "It's a Husky, so energy = 5" | Observe THIS Husky - senior/injured may be 2-3 |
| "Small dog = apartment friendly" | Small + loud barker = NOT apartment friendly |
| Guessing monthly cost | Calculate: food ($50) + vet ($30) + grooming ($40) = $120 |
| "It's friendly today, score 10" | Observe for 2+ weeks before scoring |
