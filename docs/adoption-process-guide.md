# Adoption Process Guide

## For Adoption Managers

### Overview
As an adoption manager, you are responsible for reviewing applications, processing payments, generating certificates, and completing the handover process for pet adoptions.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Application Review
- Navigate to the Applications section in your dashboard
- Review each pending application carefully
- Check applicant information, home environment, and experience
- Verify uploaded documents

**Actions:**
- **Approve**: If the applicant meets all requirements
- **Reject**: If the applicant does not meet requirements (provide reason)
- **Request Info**: If additional information is needed

#### 2. Payment Monitoring
- After approval, monitor payment status
- The system will automatically update when payment is completed
- Do not proceed to certificate generation until payment is confirmed

#### 3. Certificate Generation
- Once payment is confirmed, generate the adoption certificate
- This is a required step before scheduling handover
- The certificate includes legal terms and conditions of adoption

#### 4. Handover Scheduling
- Schedule the handover appointment at the adoption center
- Provide date, time, and any special instructions
- The system automatically generates and emails an OTP to the adopter

#### 5. Handover Completion
- When the adopter arrives, verify their OTP
- Complete the handover process in the system
- The pet ownership will be transferred automatically

### Best Practices
1. **Thorough Review**: Carefully check all application details before approval
2. **Clear Communication**: Provide detailed reasons for rejections
3. **Timely Processing**: Process applications within 24-48 hours
4. **Document Verification**: Ensure all required documents are provided
5. **OTP Security**: Never complete handover without verifying OTP
